An implementation of the CoinShuffle protocol in java. 

http://crypsys.mmci.uni-saarland.de/projects/CoinShuffle/coinshuffle.pdf

-- Overall Organization of the Project

Package protocol implements Coin Shuffle according to the same concepts as in
the original paper. It abstracts away a lot. In order to implement this version
of the protocol, a user would have to implement the following interfaces: 

    * Coin     - provides cryptocurrency functions and objects.
    * Crypto   - provides cryptographic functions and objects.
    * Messages - provides for a implementation of the messages in Coin Shuffle
    * Network  - provides a connection to the other players in the protocol. 

The purpose of this design is that a set of test cases can be developed for
the protocol as a whole before any work has been put into its details. This 
means that there can already be a huge set of test cases very early
in the development of a working version of the protocol, which will greatly 
reduce the risk of introducing errors as the rest of the development work 
proceeds. Furthermore, this protocol can be adapted to any java implementation
of Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency.

Protocol also includes a Simulator which can be used to simulate runs of the
protocol with any implementation. It allows for malicious players. As of now,
the success cases for the protocol run perfectly and so do many of the malicious
cases. The integration tests are not yet comprehensive. 

status: coming along very nicely

Package mock includes mock implementations of all these interfaces for testing
purposes.

status: functional

Package bitcoin will provide an implementation of Coin and Crypto which is
specific to the Bitcoin network and which provides the cryptography as described
in the paper. It relies on bitcoinj and Spongey Castle.

status: please someone help!

Package p2p includes classes for constructing various internet channels, by
which instances of this program will communicate. 

status: should work, let's try it. 

Package player provides for some peripheral issues about running the protocol, 
such as collecting the initial data and re-running the protocol if some players
have to be eliminated. Player is also quite abstract and could be implemented in
various ways. 

status: lots to do. 

Package moderator will have a server which will eventually help people to find
one another to create joins. It will also provide for a client that can schedule
and commit to joins. 

status: barely started

-- Uses of shuffle-java

shuffle-java will run on its own. It takes a private key and a means of 
communicating with other players, and then runs the protocol with the other 
players. 

shuffle-java can be used as a library in another application. The other wallet
would provide for an implementation of the Player class (not yet fully designed)
as well as implementations of the underlying services. (The ready-made classes
in packages bitcoin and p2p can be used in a pinch.)

-- Issues

Coin Shuffle requires the ability to look up balances on arbitrary addresses in
order to determine whether all players have enough funds to make a join
transaction. Querying arbitrary addresses is actually rather difficult unless
you just want to defer to a server like Blockchain.info. I don't yet know the
best way of providing this service on a user's own computer yet. Is there some
good open-source software for doing blockchain queries?
